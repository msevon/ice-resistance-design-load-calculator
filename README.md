# Icebreaker design calculations

This repository contains Rust code for performing essential calculations relevant to icebreaker design. These calculations include determining level ice resistance, design ice load, and ice belt plate thickness, among others.

## Getting started

To use this code for icebreaker design calculations, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install): Ensure Rust is installed on your system.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   git clone https://github.com/your-username/icebreaker_design_calculations.git
   
3. Navigate to the project directory:

   cd icebreaker_design_calculations
   
3. Build the Rust project:

   cargo build --release

### Usage

Run the compiled program:
    
    cargo run --release

Follow the prompts to input the necessary parameters for your icebreaker design.

The program will perform the calculations and display the results.
