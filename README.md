# Ice resistance and design load calculator

This repository contains Python code for performing calculations related to ice resistance and design ice load for ships operating in icy conditions. The calculations are based on Lindqvist's method for ice resistance and the IACS Polar Class Rules for design ice load calculations.

## Prerequisites

Before using this code, make sure you have Python installed on your system.

## Installation

Clone the repository to your local machine:

>git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ice-resistance-design-load-calculator.git

Navigate to the project directory:

>cd ice-resistance-design-load-calculator

## Usage

Run the Python script:

>python ice_resistance_design_load_calculator.py

Follow the prompts to input the necessary parameters for either calculating level ice resistance or design ice load.

The program will perform the calculations and display the results.

## Features

Level ice resistance calculation

Design ice load calculation
